									<h6>Privatizzazione &amp; diritto delle concessioni</h6>
									<div class="text-normal abstract">
										<p>Like most of the other countries of the former communist bloc, Albania emerged out of communism in 1991 with its economy fully owned by the government. All enterprises and assets, no matter how small, were “public” property. Since then, because of the need to jump-start the economy, develop a free market, and infuse cash, the Albanian government has undergone several rounds of “privatization” of public assets. While privatization is an umbrella term covering several distinct types of transactions, broadly speaking, it means the shift of some or all of the responsibility for a function from the government to the private sector. This can and has been done through the divestiture, by sale or long-term lease, of a state-owned enterprise to private investors. Another major form of privatization has been the granting of a long-term franchise or concession under which the private sector finances, builds, and operates a major infrastructure project. Finally, the third type of privatization has involved a public-private form of partnership—the selection by the government of a private entity to deliver a public service that had previously been produced in-house by public employees.

Members of our firm have deep and extended experience in this field both at the macro and micro level. They have been closely involved with the planning and development of the privatization strategies and respective privatization models as well as with the drafting of the legislation regulating the phases leading to and following the privatization. In addition, they have been involved in all phases of almost all the major privatizations performed by the Albanian government in the last decade, including the preparation of the necessary documentation related to strategic privatizations of public companies in the energy production, energy distribution, telecommunications, and insurance sectors or the privatization of specific important assets.

As part of the larger context of privatization, our experience in the area of concession is also unique. Our members have spearheaded the drafting of legislation and related administrative acts and documentation concerning concessions at all levels, including the drafting of the tender documentation templates. Members of our firm have been responsible for negotiating the agreements and for overseeing the issuance of some of the most significant concessionary licenses such as in the energy sector (from hydropower plants to wind farms), in the infrastructure sector (including those related to major regional gas pipelines), in the production of documentation under state monopoly, in the quality assurance and control of the hydrocarbon products, etc. Thus, our firm has the required expertise to assist clients in all stages of privatization and concession procedures, including the following:</p>
										<p>Legal advice on the implementation of the concession or privatization agreements</p>
										<ul>
										<li>Consultation and preparation of all relevant documentation for participation in the concession or privatization procedures</li>
										<li>Consultations, provision of written statements/ legal opinions, on tender documents issued by the public authorities</li>
										<li>Conducting field and document related due diligence regarding the concession/privatization process</li>
										<li>Representation of clients in different stages of concession or privatization agreements —application, conclusion, performance, amendment and termination</li>
										<li>Representation in concession/privatization-related disputes.</li>
										</ul>
