										<p style="text-align: justify;">Franci Nuri is a Senior Associate with Frost & Fire Consulting. Mr. Nuri has spent a considerable amount of his adult life in France and has invested considerably in his legal education while there, in the academia and beyond.</p>
										<p></p>
										<p style="text-align: justify;">or to joining Frost & Fire Consulting in February 2014, Mr. Nuri worked for about one year as a Legal Counsel at Erytech Pharma SA, a French company listed in the stock exchange, specialized in the area of developing innovative therapies based on red blood cells for treating severe forms of cancer and orphan drugs. During this precious professional experience, Mr. Nuri drafted various agreements with international companies, public or scientific institutions and handled various Trade Marks protections via the WIPO procedures.

In addition, he has been involved with “Service des Traducteurs d’Urgence”, a French NGO created to provide legal consultations and legal interpretation. During his tenure with Frost & Fire Consulting Mr. Nuri has gained a strong expertise in drafting legal opinions and contracts for private or public entities, in a very wide range of areas which include almost all aspects of the Albanian legal framework.

He has also been involved in several important investment projects where Albanian legislation on privatization, strategic investments and tourism have been the key components. Recently, Mr. Nuri has been part of various projects with national or international institutions responsible for environmental protection, such as the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, in order to approximate and improve Albanian legislation in line with the European Union Acquis. Furthermore, Mr. Nuri has been licensed by the Albanian Directorate of Industrial Property as a trademark authorized person, a status that enables him to proceed with the registration of domestic and foreign trademarks.</p>
