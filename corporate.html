										<p>Frost &amp; Fire Consulting's corporate lawyers have participated in many important business and financial transactions in Albania and throughout the world. Their collective experience spans all stages of the journey of a business entity, from incorporation to assisting borrowers with credit facilities; sellers and buyers with acquisitions, dispositions, or investments; underwriters and issuers with IPOs or bond offerings; corporate clients' boards on a broad array of corporate governance best practices; international clients on various cross-border transactions; private equity clients with strategic acquisitions and investments, to restructuring large public companies or negotiating multibillion gas transshipment agreements. Our team could help with corporate and business transactions in any of the following areas:</p>

										<p></p>
										<ul>
										<li><a name="Antitrust"></a><strong>Antitrust.</strong> Whether you are considering a new business transaction or your day-to-day business practice encounters potential antitrust issues, our team can work with you from the outset to develop a strategy to assess antitrust implications and structure transactions to address any potential issues in a preemptive manner. The diverse expertise combined with our significant experience enables us to provide our clients with practical solutions, including proper risk allocation, negotiating remedies with enforcement authorities, and ongoing compliance obligations under such remedies.</li>
										<p></p>
										<li><a name="Banking"></a><strong>Banking and Finance.</strong> As members of our team have worked both with borrowers and with major financial and international lending institutions such as JPMorgan Chase, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, World Bank, IMF, EBRD, etc., assisting them with credit agreements, leveraged and investment-grade acquisition financings, asset-based financings, leveraged spin-offs, and other complex international multijurisdictional financings, we have the required expertise to assist our clients with all of their banking or financing needs.</li>
										<p></p>
										<li><a name="Corporate"></a><strong>Corporate Governance.</strong> While this area of the law may be somewhat new for Albania and the region, as the market matures, boards of various corporations are facing the need for professional advice to handle risk management, disclosure or other compliance matters, fact-finding exercises with respect to potential violations, coordinating responses to governmental authorities, and a slew of other situations involving difficult governance issues. In assisting our clients with corporate governance issues, our team members draw from their experiences in working with the boards of major local companies such as the supervisory board of the Albanian Power Distribution and Supply Company, the board of the Albanian Transmission System Operator, the supervisory board of Albtelecom, the supervisory board of Albpetrol, the board of directors of the National Natural Resources Agency, as well as the boards of international giants such as Time Warner Inc.</li>
										<p></p>
										<li><a name="Due"></a><strong>Due Diligence.</strong> Our team can offer top-quality due diligence services in all the required aspects of business transactions. We have considerable experience with the diligence of very complex transactions, and members of our team have led diligence teams composed of many lawyers and paralegals for a multitude of national and international clients.</li>
										<p></p>
										<li><a name="Environmental"></a><strong>Environmental Law.</strong> Environmental matters are increasingly intricate, and if they are not handled properly, they may bring financial and reputational havoc on any company. Albania has recently passed a new law on the protection of the environment that establishes a framework for environmental liability based on the "polluter pays" principle in line with European Union legislation. Some of the most significant provisions concern the environmental impact assessments, the permission regimes for usage of some types of resources, some restrictions on the use of natural resources in view of preserving the ecological balance, Aarhus convention compliance requirements, etc. Drawing from our diverse and complementary experiences in this area of the law, the Frost &amp; Fire team can assist clients on a full range of environmental matters and related compliance that arise in business transactions.</li>
										<p></p>
										<li><a name="International"></a><strong>International. </strong>In an increasingly global economy, our team's corporate lawyers advise clients on a wide range of international transactions, including cross-border mergers and acquisitions, private equity deals, international capital markets, and other cross-border financings, including IPOs, bond offerings, and bank financings. We also have a particular interest in public international law as well as international trade law issues pertaining to Southeastern Europe and beyond involving multiple jurisdictions, including matters covering maritime-related issues or disputes such as maritime delimitation of the territorial sea or continental shelf with particular regard to the Adriatic and Ionian seas.</li>
										<p></p>
										<li><a name="Mergers"></a><strong>Mergers and Acquisitions.</strong> We advise on a full range of merger and acquisition transactions in a wide variety of industries. Members of our team have assisted various clients with mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, and spin-offs such as the multibillion spin-off of Time Warner Cable from Time Warner Inc. in the United States or the spin-off of three different companies from the Albanian Power Company.</li>
										<p></p>
										<li><a name="Procurement"></a><strong>Procurement.</strong> Our team members bring to the table a wealth of experience with a variety of public institutions' procurement and selection processes. We are intimately familiar and assist our clients with preparation and submission of tender documents for various types of procurement procedures whether in accordance with the Albanian public procurement rules or those of international financial institutions such as the World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the European Investment Bank, etc.</li>
										<p></p>
										<li><a name="Private"></a><strong>Private Equity.</strong> Throughout their career, Frost &amp; Fire Consulting team members have worked with a number of well-established international private equity firms such as Ripplewood Holdings, Apollo Global Management, Lindsay Goldberg, AP Alternative Assets LP, etc., assisting them with several aspects of transactional work, including the purchase and sale of their portfolio assets, leveraged buyouts, as well as novel transactions such as the reorganization of private equity funds in public companies and their subsequent listing in Euronext, Brussels. We have also assisted international funds operating regionally such as NCH Capital with novel transactions for the local market.</li>
										<p></p>
										<li><a name="Real"></a><strong>Real Estate.</strong> The experience of our members in the real estate sector encompasses a broad range of real estate transactions, including real estate fund offerings, portfolio acquisitions, and joint ventures as well as more traditional real estate development, purchase, sale, financing, and restructuring transactions. Our partners have worked with local as well as international clients such as the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Funds and O'Connor Capital Partners.</li>
										<p></p>
										<li><a name="Securities"></a><strong>Securities.</strong> While the capital market in Albania and the region is still in its infancy, established and visionary businesses are increasingly realizing the potential that can be fulfilled through engaging in such transactions. Because of their extended international experience in the most developed capital markets, where they have assisted issuers and underwriters in all types of U.S. and global offerings, including initial public offerings, different types of corporate bond offerings, private placements, and offerings of securities collateralized by various kinds of assets, our team is fully prepared to assist the Albanian and regional business as they embark in this path.
